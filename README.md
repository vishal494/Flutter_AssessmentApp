# Flutter_AssessmentApp
This app is used to take the first level of interview

First level of interview wait time in a organisation is always huge, so I have created this smart assessment app to take the first level of interview. Right now i have designed it take the JAVA , Arithmetic and QA-functional sections with dummy questions. 
Hope i make this app highly dynamic so user can select the role he's applying for and will be assessed accordingly in a dynamic fashion.!
